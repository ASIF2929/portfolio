                   <p>&emsp; &emsp;Hello, my name is Kovuri Reddy Ashif. I recently completed my B.tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Madanapalle Institute of Technology and Science. I also hold a Diploma in Engineering from Govt-Polytechnic, Kalikiri, and completed my secondary education at Santhinikethan High School, Kalikiri.</p>
                    <p>&emsp; &emsp;During my academic journey, I developed a keen interest in the field of technology and its applications. I have worked on several projects, including "Home Automation using Web and IoT," where I utilized Python, Raspberry Pi, and UNIX to create a home control system controlled through a mobile application. 
                        Another noteworthy project was the "Speed Detector for Highways," where I used Java and hardware micro-controllers to design a device that can measure vehicle speed using UV signals and provide alerts.</p>
                    <p>&emsp; &emsp;In addition to my academic achievements, I learnt programming skills include Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I have a basic understanding of Python.</p>
                    <p>&emsp; &emsp;To further enhance my technical knowledge, I have undergone training in Java, HTML, and SQL at JSpiders and completed a one-month internship on "Electronic Manufacturing and PCB Design" at SNAHPL, Bangalore.</p>
                    <p>&emsp; &emsp;I possess a CAN DO attitude and consider myself a creative thinker. I am ambitious and always strive to achieve new heights in my career. I enjoy collaborating with others and believe in the power of teamwork to accomplish goals.</p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;In my spare time, I have attended workshops on topics like ethical hacking at IIT Tirupathi and participated in a Python training program at MITS college.</p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Apart from my technical skills, I am fluent in Telugu, English, and Hindi, and I have also completed the "Introduction to Cybersecurity" course offered by Cisco, which has provided me with a solid foundation in cybersecurity concepts.</p>                    
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;I am excited about the opportunities ahead and eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in the field of technology. Thank you for considering my profile.</p>
