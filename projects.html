                    <li>Automatic evening lamp
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;An automatic evening lamp using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) is a clever solution for providing illumination as darkness falls. The LDR senses the ambient light level, and when it reaches a certain threshold, it triggers the lamp to turn on automatically. This eliminates the need for manual intervention and ensures that the surroundings are adequately lit during evening hours. By utilizing the LDR's light sensing capability, the automatic evening lamp enhances convenience and energy efficiency in our daily lives.</p>

                    <li>water-tank overflow alarm
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;A water tank overflow alarm built with BC547 transistors is a reliable solution for preventing water wastage and potential damage. The BC547 transistors act as switches to detect the water level in the tank. When the water reaches a critical point, the transistors trigger an alarm, alerting users to take necessary action. This simple yet effective circuit helps in maintaining optimal water levels and avoiding overflow incidents.</p>
